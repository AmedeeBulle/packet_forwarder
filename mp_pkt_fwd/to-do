Todo list for release:
- Change configuration to structs of related parameters
- Create generic transport layer to encapsulate different transports
  generic layer should:
  - have no blocking calls (due to TCP timeouts or other causes) on transmit
  - retry connecting where appropriate
  - encapsulate transport specific statistics
- Move jit statistics to jit source
- Implement FSK down in TTN transport
- Write build instructions, required due to dependencies
